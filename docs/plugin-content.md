# Plugin blocks and tags

Plugins add blocks in code or from JSON files that Obsidian's source generator turns into code, and add tags with data
pack tag files, like NeoForge and Fabric mods. Clients need the matching mod: NeoForge and Fabric clients are sent the
block and item registries, so their ids agree with the server's.

## Blocks in code

```csharp
public override void ConfigureRegistry(IPluginRegistry registry)
{
    var lamp = registry.RegisterBlock("ruby:lamp", new BlockProperties
    {
        StateProperties = [StateProperty.Bool("lit"), StateProperty.Int("power", 0, 3)],
        DefaultState = new Dictionary<string, string> { ["lit"] = "false" },
        Hardness = 0.5f,
        LightEmission = 7,
        Behavior = new LampBehavior()
    });

    var lit = lamp.With(lamp.DefaultState, "lit", "true");
}
```

The block's identifier is in the plugin's namespace (its id). Unless `Item` is null, an item with the same identifier
places the block and is what it drops. A client mod has to declare the same block with the same properties and values
in the same order: bool properties are `true, false`, int ones ascending, enum ones in the order given.

## Blocks from JSON

Each `data/<namespace>/blocks/<name>.json` in the plugin's data folder is a block, shaped like an entry of vanilla's
blocks report:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "lit": ["true", "false"],
    "power": ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
    "color": ["red", "green"]
  },
  "default": { "lit": "false" },
  "hardness": 0.5,
  "lightEmission": 7,
  "behavior": "Ruby.LampBehavior",
  "item": { "maxStackSize": 16 }
}
```

True and false make a bool property and consecutive numbers an int one; anything else is an enum property in the
order listed. The other keys are `BlockProperties`' (`hasCollision`, `opaque`, `hardness`, `explosionResistance`,
`requiresCorrectTool`, `lightEmission`), `behavior` is an `IBlockBehavior` type's full name, and `item` is false for a
block without an item.

The generator makes a `RubyBlocks` class (from the namespace) in the plugin assembly's namespace, with a property per
block, a typed state per block with properties (`RubyBlocks.LampState`, with `From(IBlock)` and `ToBlock()`) and enums
for enum properties. Register them from `ConfigureRegistry`:

```csharp
RubyBlocks.Register(registry);
var state = new RubyBlocks.LampState(Lit: true, Power: 2, Color: RubyBlocks.LampColor.Green).ToBlock();
```

Obsidian.MSBuild gives the data folder's files to the generator; without it, add the project's `data` folder's files
as `AdditionalFiles`.

## Tags

Tags are data pack tag files: `data/<namespace>/tags/block/<path>.json` or `tags/item/...`, with `values`
(identifiers, `#` followed by a tag, or `{ "id": ..., "required": false }`), `replace`, and NeoForge's `remove`. A
file for a vanilla tag adds to it, for example `data/minecraft/tags/block/mineable/pickaxe.json` to mine a block with a
pickaxe; other files make new tags, like the shared `c:` ones. Obsidian merges vanilla's tags with the loaded plugins'
files in load order whenever a plugin loads or unloads, and vanilla's `Tag` objects hold the result, so server code
using them sees the plugins' entries. `IPluginRegistry.AddToTag` adds entries from code.

The generator makes a `RubyTags` class with a `TagKey` per tag of the plugin's namespaces:

```csharp
if (RubyTags.Blocks.Ores.Contains(block))
    ...
```

A tag whose required entry is missing keeps its earlier entries rather than disappearing, as server code holds
vanilla's tags. When tags refer to each other through optional references, the reference that would close the cycle
is left out in identifier order, where vanilla's order depends on its hash map. Players already connected get changed
tags once reconfiguring them exists.
