# Vanilla scenario captures

The redstone, fluid, daylight detector and sulfur parity tests replay scenarios recorded on a headless vanilla
server. Each fixture in `Obsidian.Tests/Assets` is its own input: it holds every scenario's definition, and a capture
replaces only what vanilla produced.

- `redstone_scenarios.json` (`VanillaRedstone`) defines each scenario's box, setup, actions, reloads, entity contacts
  and arrows; the capture records a checkpoint per tick and each reload's `ticks`.
- `fluid_scenarios.json` (`VanillaFluids`) defines the box, setup fills, actions, dimension and checkpoint ticks; the
  capture records the checkpoints.
- `daylight_detector.json` (`DaylightDetectorTests`) defines the clock times to sample; the capture records the
  readings.
- `sulfur_scenarios.json` (`VanillaSulfurBlocks`) defines setup, actions, watched positions and sampling intervals.
  It records full block states and potent sulfur countdowns at absolute game times, including elapsed ticks across
  save/restart actions. Its world seed is `test-seed`. Cases with `recordEntities` also sample live falling blocks,
  damaging falling blocks and total item counts (`item` selects the item; sulfur spikes by default).
  Extra `sampleTicks` check the interval before landing
  as well as the completed fall, so immediate disappearance, missing drops and endlessly falling entities fail.
  `recordProjectile` samples embedded projectiles; projectile actions exercise collision handling through the live
  entity tick. RCON samples do not record sound effects.
  `spawnFalling` supplies a block, position and motion; `recordFallingMotion` records its height, vertical velocity
  and grounded flag. The sand references cover a full floor, a partial floor and waiting for a moving piston to
  clear. `withoutBlockEntity` validates the absence of a block entity after vanilla's bare moving-piston placement;
  the replay removes Obsidian's automatically created default entity to reproduce that fixture's block view.
  The dripstone column references cover shape changes on adding and removing tips in both vertical directions.
- `sulfur_fixtures.json` (also `VanillaSulfurBlocks`) holds bounded Java probes for sulfur placement, growth and
  subsequent random draws, gas source/visibility, geyser force and fall-distance handling, trident thresholds and
  raw falling-spike damage. `Java/SulfurFixtures.java`, registered in `FixtureDumper.cs`, invokes vanilla's routines
  against each case's block view. Growth writes are recorded without neighbor notifications; the RCON scenarios
  separately cover the live update path. The impact target records the raw damage passed by vanilla's falling
  entity, before armor and other victim-specific mitigation.
  The `review_landing_*` probes instead supply a resolved ground contact and invoke vanilla's falling entity tick;
  they record removal, item drops and level events for every combination of `entity_drops`, `DropItem`, `CancelDrop`
  and `Silent`. The replay checks both item totals and the clients' landing-effect packets.
  The `shape_*` probes record vanilla's returned shape and scheduled water ticks for wet and dry panes, bars,
  leaves, sulfur spikes and pointed dripstone. Each reference is replayed through both the notification pipeline
  and the fluid shape-update path, including cases where a registered behavior returns an unchanged state.

Each file's `_notes` describes exactly how it was recorded, and `version` names the vanilla version; the tests check it
against the version Obsidian implements.

## Re-recording

```sh
dotnet build Obsidian.AssetGenerator -t:CaptureVanillaScenarios
dotnet build Obsidian.AssetGenerator -t:CaptureVanillaScenarios -p:CaptureFixtures=redstone+daylight

dotnet build Obsidian.AssetGenerator -t:CaptureVanillaScenarios -p:CaptureFixtures=sulfur

dotnet build Obsidian.AssetGenerator -t:CaptureVanillaScenarios -p:CaptureFixtures=sulfur -p:CaptureCases=spike_shatters_after_falling+review_spike_pending_fall_keeps_frustum
```

This uses the server of the Minecraft version `Obsidian.csproj` targets, from the shared vanilla cache (see
[vanilla captures](vanilla-captures.md#the-vanilla-cache)), and needs Java 25. The sulfur capture takes about 30 seconds.
To add a scenario, add its definition with placeholder checkpoints (the redstone capture records as many ticks as the
scenario has checkpoints) and capture again; the tests pick it up.

For sulfur, `CaptureCases` accepts exact scenario names separated by `+`. It replaces only those cases' checkpoints
and skips the Java probes. Other scenarios retain their stored absolute times and are replayed independently.
`SulfurFixtures.java` also accepts an optional second argument of exact `+`-separated probe names, when run directly
with the vanilla server and libraries on the classpath, to re-record only new or changed Java cases.

The underlying command is `Obsidian.AssetGenerator capture-scenarios <minecraft version> <cache directory>
<scratch directory> <test assets directory> [redstone+fluids+daylight+sulfur] [sulfur case names]`.

## How it captures

`ScenarioCaptures.cs` drives the server over RCON (`ScenarioServer.cs`):

- **The world** is a void superflat, and a data pack makes the nether one too while keeping its dimension type (fast
  lava). Random ticks, mob spawning and weather are off. Each scenario's chunks are force-loaded, so they keep ticking
  and load before the first tick after a restart.
- **Time** is frozen by the data pack's load function, which runs in the first tick after every start, so a start runs
  exactly one game tick. Each scenario tick is one `/tick step 1`, waited on until the game time moves.
- **Blocks** are placed with `/setblock` (live, with updates) or `/fill … strict` (fluid setup, without updates), and
  read with `execute if block`: first the block's previous state, then its id among likely ones, then each property's
  values in turn. Palettes hold full states with every property, sorted by name.
- **Reloads** save the world, stop the server and start it again; the captured `ticks` is how far the game time moved.
- **Entities** are armor stands standing in each contact cell from their event to the next one, and **arrows** fly
  straight into the face at the given location without gravity, so they cross it exactly there.
- **Daylight readings** set the overworld clock to each sample, at each phase of the update interval in turn, and
  step to the next game time that is a multiple of 20, when detectors update; vanilla ticks the clocks before the
  levels, so the clock's time then is the time the detectors saw.

Between scenarios, the area is cleared without updates and the game runs a few ticks, so that work a scenario left
scheduled finds air and is dropped.
